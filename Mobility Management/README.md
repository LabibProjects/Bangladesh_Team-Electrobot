Mobility Management
====
In the realm of mobility management for our vehicle, we meticulously select and implement motors based on engineering principles like speed, torque, and power, while also considering chassis design and component mounting for optimal performance. Assembly instructions and 3D CAD files are available for easy part fabrication.

# Motor Selection and Implementation:
### 1. Motor Selection:
   - We carefully considered various factors like vehicle weight, desired speed, and torque requirements to make the right choice of motors. For our obstacle-avoiding bot, we opted for DC motors and servo motors to ensure precise control.
   - We performed calculations to determine the necessary torque, taking into account the bot's weight, wheel size, and the maximum slope it might encounter.
   - We also took into consideration the power supply and voltage requirements of the motors we selected.

### 2. Motor Controller:
   - We chose an appropriate motor controller, the BTS7960, to effectively control the motors.
   - We made sure that the motor controller was compatible with our microcontroller or control board.

### 3. Implementation:
   - We connected the motors to the motor controller and then linked the controller to the JRC Board.

# Chassis Design and Selection:
### 1. Chassis Material: Plastic with a steel alloy base.
### 2. Chassis Shape:
   - We designed the chassis to accommodate all the components, including motors, sensors, and the power source.
   - We ensured that the chassis provided adequate ground clearance and stability.

### 3. Mounting Components:
   - We carefully planned the layout of components on the chassis to ensure an even weight distribution and easy access for maintenance.
   - Subsequently, we securely mounted the motors, ultrasonic sensor, gyroscope, JRC booster, Husylens, and the power supply.

### 4. Engineering Principles:
   - We calculated the center of mass to maintain stability.
   - We took into account the wheelbase and track width to optimize maneuverability.
   - We paid attention to proper weight distribution to prevent tipping.

# Building and Assembly Instructions:
### 1. Step-by-Step Assembly:
   - We provided clear, step-by-step instructions for assembling the vehicle, starting from the chassis and moving on to component mounting.
   - Additionally, we included wiring diagrams to assist in connecting motors, sensors, and controllers.

### 2. 3D Printing Parts:
   - WE designed Sonar mount and wheels for better optimization in Auodesk Fusion360.
   - We also included instructions for printing these parts, specifying recommended materials and settings.

### 3. Testing and Calibration:
   - We explained how to calibrate the vehicle's sensors and motor controllers.
   - We provided guidance on testing the vehicle's basic movements and its ability to detect obstacles effectively.

### 4. Safety Considerations:
   - We emphasized safety precautions when working with motors, electronics, and power sources, ensuring that safety was a top priority throughout the project.

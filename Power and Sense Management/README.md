The HuskyLens is a smart vision sensor used for various applications, including object detection, tracking, and recognition. In your configuration, you mentioned that the HuskyLens is powered by 5V, which is sourced from a JRC Board. This JRC Board is connected to an MP1584 voltage regulator, which, in turn, is connected to an XT4015 module. All of these components are powered by an 11.1V LiPo battery.
- #### **Gyroscope:**
